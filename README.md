#### Process?

1. Display a dummy image for all single characters. [done]

2. Make an HTTP request to populate your frontend application using the API
    - Display a list with the names of each person from the API request. [done]
    - On Clicking any name, display the details of that user on the screen, with name, gender, and height only. [done]

3. All implementations should be done using es6. [done]

4. Make your design pretty and responsive.

#### TODO
1. Work on responsiveness.
2. Pagination.
3. Fix: hide the already shown user data when clicking on another one or clicking anywhere on the document.
4. Implement search box functionality.
5. Implement the filter search functionality (on clicking planets, films...etc should fetch data for such selection).
